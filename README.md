# Mind Weave
__Open-source multi-module Spring Boot middleware enhancing Home Assistant with advanced AI (like Gemini) for natural language control, data analysis, and intelligent smart home features.__

## Project Vision
Mind Weave aims to bridge the gap between powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini and the Home Assistant smart home ecosystem. By acting as a flexible middleware layer, it will enable:
* __Natural Language Interaction__: Control your home and query its status using conversational language via interfaces like Telegram and Home Assistant's Assist.
* __Intelligent Insights__: Leverage AI to analyze historical data from your sensors and devices, providing insights and suggesting automation ideas.
* __Contextual Awareness__: Go beyond simple automations by allowing the AI to understand the context of your home and provide proactive assistance.
* __Modular and Adaptable__: Built with a multi-module Spring Boot architecture, designed to be easily extended, adapted to different Home Assistant setups, and support various LLM providers via a common interface.
* __Community Driven__: Developed as an open-source project, encouraging contributions from the Home Assistant and JVM development communities.

## Status
This project is currently in its very early stages of development. The repository has been created, and initial planning is underway. No functional code has been written yet.

## Technology Stack
* __Language__: Java (with potential for Kotlin in future modules)
* __Framework__: Spring Boot
* __Build Tool__: Gradle
* __Runtime Environment__: JVM on Linux (primarily targeting Debian)
* __Containerization__: Docker
* __Smart Home Platform__: Home Assistant
* __AI Models__: Gemini (initial target), with an interface for other LLMs (GPT, etc.)
* __Messaging__: MQTT, Telegram Bot API, Home Assistant APIs (REST, WebSocket)
* __Database__: External database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for Mind Weave's internal data and potentially Home Assistant history export.

## Planned Modules
The project is planned as a multi-module Spring Boot application, with key components including:
* `mindweave-core`: Core logic and orchestration.
* `mindweave-config`: Configuration loading and management.
* `mindweave-mapping-rules`: Handling dynamic, externalized automation rules and mappings.
* `mindweave-io-comm`: Communication interfaces (Telegram, HA Assist).
* `mindweave-api-ha`: Home Assistant API client.
* `mindweave-api-ai`: LLM API client interface and implementations.
* `mindweave-data-db`: Database access and management.
* `mindweave-feature-inventory`: Kitchen inventory logic.
* `mindweave-feature-analysis`: Historical data analysis logic.
* `mindweave-feature-cost-audit`: LLM cost tracking.
* `mindweave-api-external`: Clients for other external services (e.g., Calendar).

## Getting Started
_(This section will be updated as development progresses)_

Currently, this repository contains only project setup files. Instructions on building, configuring, and running Mind Weave will be added here once initial development milestones are reached.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community! Since the project is just starting, contributions can currently include:
* Providing feedback on the planned architecture and requirements.
* Sharing insights or experiences with similar integrations or technologies.
* Suggesting features or use cases.
Once development begins, contributions will expand to code, documentation, testing, and more. Please feel free to open an issue or discussion on this repository to get involved.
